# Social media dashboard with theme switcher (Clone Project, designs from Frontend Mentor)

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The Project

Used CSS, HTML, and vanilla JavaScript to recreate designs, provided by Frontend Mentor, that were in the form of JPG images. I did not have exact numbers, etc. for page elements, so I used my best judgement based on the pictures I was provided.

The goal was to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to re-create a social media tracker dashboard and implement the option to toggle between a dark mode and a light mode. To implement the theme changes I made use of variables in CSS and used JavaScript to toggle between a dark mode and light mode class in the HTML file.

The social media tracker should be responsive and resize depending on the size of the screen. To make sure the site would be responsive I used flexbox and media queries in CSS.
